## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas and I live in the south of Brazil (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=825e01edc18a56f7&sca_upv=1&q=florianopolis&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0AuaLfhdrtx2b9ODfK0pnmiw5nSZwNlVfEzuxKLWTKEHXt5IY2W8nQL2YIQAPJugdjnyungMiDacVc1U-cdjtDc-41tMD6P0rkTK_d0IegjWrL-lNSX43UP7CG5vnhSzhsWuiMrPxScbJjMWayTSAS_gZSz77sElJSTy8gdTareUVUcuZsJZgLR3ruCCojxzT6tcSHBXgRqThkI3FjiAJRtJoF53A&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtxf75p8qIAxUNHbkGHTX4AmkQtKgLegQIDBAB&biw=1536&bih=735&dpr=1.25">FlorianÃ³polis-SC</a>)

Since 2013 I have been working with health data, specially on public sector.
As a background, I use to work as a nurse practicioner (bachelor's degree) and have a master's degree on public health.

Nowadays I have been working as a specialized consultant for health data, data analyst and database developer.
